I used the following sites to get this working:

- https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-11-reveal/
- https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-50-presentations/
- https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/tree/master/samples/reveal
- http://jr0cket.co.uk/2013/10/create-cool-slides--Org-mode-Revealjs.html
- http://jr0cket.co.uk/2014/01/github-pages-for-revealjs-slides-via-emacs-org-mode.html.html

As I already have a github.pages site, I just made a =slides= repo.
Then I cloned it, made a branch =gh-pages=, and changed to working in this branch.
Once this was done, I went to my homepage repo. There I added a =slides.org= page and a link in =conf.py= to my github.pages site.
Finally, I put a link in to my presentations in the =slides.org= page.
And that was all I had to do, except for the final =nikola github_deploy=.
